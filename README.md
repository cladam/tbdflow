# Trunk-Based Development CLI

A simple, powerful command-line interface (CLI) to streamline your Git workflow, especially for teams practicing Trunk-Based Development (TBD).

This tool provides automated commands for both the primary "commit-to-main" workflow and the structured management of short-lived branches for features, releases, and hotfixes.

## Philosophy

This tool is designed with a specific Trunk-Based Development philosophy in mind:

* **Commit to Main is the Default:** The primary `commit` command is your day-to-day workhorse. It automates the process of pulling the latest changes, committing, and pushing directly to the `main` branch, encouraging small, frequent integrations.
* **Branches are Exceptions, Not the Rule:** Branches are supported but are treated as short-lived exceptions for specific scenarios (larger features, release stabilization, hotfixes).
* **Automated Cleanup:** The `complete` command enforces the "short-lived" nature of branches by automating the merge-and-delete process, keeping your repository clean.
* **Conventional Commits:** The tool encourages the use of Conventional Commits for clear, consistent commit messages.

### Why Not Just Use Git Directly?

This tool is **not** a replacement for Git. You will and should always use `git` directly for complex or uncommon tasks like interactive rebasing, cherry-picking, or running `git bisect`.

The purpose of this CLI is to act as a **workflow encapsulator**. It codifies a specific, opinionated process to provide three key benefits:

1.  **Consistency:** It ensures every developer on the team follows the exact same sequence of steps for common tasks. Every commit, every feature branch, and every release is handled identically, leading to a clean and predictable Git history.
2.  **Reduced Cognitive Load:** You no longer have to remember the exact flags or command sequence for your workflow (e.g., `pull --rebase`, `merge --no-ff`, conventional commit syntax). The tool remembers the process for you, so you can focus on your code.
3.  **The TBD Way:** The tool makes the right way the easy way. It creates a simple, safe, and efficient path for the 90% of daily development tasks, reducing the chance of errors.

For the other 10% of tasks, drop down to raw `git`—that's what it's there for!

## Installation & Publishing

You can run the tool directly from the source code for development or publish it as a standalone executable for easy, system-wide use.

### Running from Source
1.  **Prerequisites:** You must have the [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) installed.
2.  **Clone the repository:** `git clone <your-repo-url>`
3.  **Run the tool:** All commands are run from the project's root directory using `dotnet run --`.

### Publishing an Executable
To create a standalone executable that you can run from anywhere:

1.  **Publish the application.** For an Apple Silicon Mac, use:
    ```bash
    dotnet publish -c Release -r osx-arm64 --self-contained true -p:PublishSingleFile=true
    ```
2.  **Locate the executable.** It will be in the `bin/Release/net8.0/osx-arm64/publish/` directory.
3.  **(Optional) Add to your PATH.** Copy the executable to a directory in your system's PATH (e.g., `/usr/local/bin`) to make it callable from any terminal session.

## Commands

### 1. `commit`

Commits staged changes directly to the `main` branch with a Conventional Commits message. This is the primary command for daily work.

**Usage:**
```bash
tbdflow commit [options]
```
**Options:**

| Flag | Option      | Description                                   | Required |
|------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------|
| -t   | --type      | The type of commit (e.g., feat, fix, chore).  | Yes      |
| -s   | --scope     | The scope of the changes (e.g., api, ui).     | No       |
| -m   | --message   | The descriptive commit message.               | Yes      |
| -b   | --breaking  | Mark the commit as a breaking change.         | No       |

**Example:**
```bash
# A new feature
tbdflow commit -t "feat" -s "auth" -m "Add password reset endpoint"

# A bug fix with a breaking change
tbdflow commit -t "fix" -m "Correct user permission logic" -b
```

### 2.`feature` / `release` / `hotfix`

Creates a new, short-lived branch from the latest version of `main.

**Usage:**
```bash
# For features or hotfixes
tbdflow <feature|hotfix> --name <branch-name>

# For releases
tbdflow release --version <version-number> [options]
```

`release` ** Command Options:**

| Flag | Option        | Description                                    | Required |
|------|---------------|------------------------------------------------|----------|
| -f   | --from-commit | Optional commit hash on `main` to branch from. | No       |


**Examples:**

```bash
# Create a feature branch
tbdflow feature -n "user-profile-page"

# Create a release branch
tbdflow release -v "2.1.0"

# Create a hotfix branch
tbdflow hotfix -n "critical-auth-bug"
```

### 3. complete

Merges a short-lived branch back into main, then deletes the local and remote copies of the branch.

**Usage:**
```bash
tbdflow complete --type <branch-type> --name <branch-name>
```

**Options:**

| Flag | Option   | Description                                             | Required |
|------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| -t   | --type   | The type of branch: feature, release, or hotfix.        | Yes      |
| -n   | --name   | The name or version of the branch to complete.          | Yes      |

**Examples:**
```bash
# Complete a feature branch
tbdflow complete -t "feature" -n "user-profile-page"

# Complete a release branch
tbdflow complete -t "release" -n "2.1.0"
```
